# phonegap_android_project_generator
Generator simple projects phonegap for android. 
Now it works only on Linux, and maybe macOs. 
To start, you just need to specify the directory with projects in which will be index.html and icon.png as an argument.
It will look something like this "./generator.py projectFolder/" or "python3 generator.py projectFolder/".
